# Word Recognition using Python

This project is a **Word Recognition System** built in Python.  
It allows users to **upload an image containing a word**, and the trained model will **predict the word**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Upload an image containing a word (e.g., handwritten or printed).
- Preprocessing of the image (grayscale, thresholding, noise removal).
- Model predicts the text/word from the image.
- Uses OCR / Deep Learning-based recognition.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for model building, optional if training a custom model)
- **OpenCV** (for image preprocessing)
- **Tesseract OCR** (for recognition if using OCR approach)
- **Flask / Streamlit** (for building a user-friendly interface)


üìå Word Recognition Project ‚Äì Step-by-Step Plan

Set Up Environment

    Create a project folder (word-recognition/).
    Prepare subfolders: data/, models/, and files like app.py, preprocess.py, predict.py.
    Create requirements.txt for dependencies.

Install Required Libraries

    Install image processing (OpenCV, Pillow),
    OCR (pytesseract) or ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch),
    UI (Flask or Streamlit).

Image Preprocessing

    Load image.
    Convert to grayscale.
    Apply thresholding (binarization).
    Remove noise and resize for consistency.

Word Prediction

    Option A (Quick): Use OCR (Tesseract) to extract the word.
    Option B (Advanced): Train a CNN/LSTM model on a word dataset, save model, and use it for predictions.

Build User Interface

    Use Streamlit or Flask for uploading images.
    Show the uploaded image on the UI.
    Display the predicted word output.

Testing

    Collect sample images with words (printed + handwritten).
    Upload them via UI.
    Validate predictions, adjust preprocessing steps if needed.

Deployment

    Deploy locally first.
    Optionally host on Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS for web access.

Future Enhancements

    Extend to multiple words (sentence recognition).
    Improve handwriting recognition accuracy.
    Add support for multiple languages.
    Build an API endpoint for integration with other apps.
